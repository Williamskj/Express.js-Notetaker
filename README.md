## Description
This application is a simple note taker primarly using multiple get, post, and delete routes using express.js. It allows the client to create notes with a body and title, then store that note in a json file on their local machine. 
## Installation
One must have node, express.js, and a working terminal/Bash to get the code to work on their local machine. However, one could also simply head to the deployed application linked further down in this README to use it.
## Usage
If one wishes to use the application without installation, they simply must go to the link at the bottom of the README and head  to the deployed application on Heroku, at which point they can use the notetaker as much as they desire. To use the notetaker, simply type a title and a body for your note, and click on the floppy disk symbol on the top right corner of the screen to save the note. To delete it, click on the red garbage can symbol next to your note on the left side of the screen.
